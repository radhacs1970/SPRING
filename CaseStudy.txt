Do the following operations using spring restcontroller and jpa either using h2 db or mysql db server.

Create a Employee class with attributes employee id, firstname, lastname, loginusername, loginpassword, designation, leavebalance.

Initially create 5 employees with leavebalance to 20 


showallemployees
showemployeegivenid
Addnewemployee
updateemployee details given id

The functionality is to apply leave for the employee:
specify start and end of leave. 
The start date should be greater than or equal to today and end date should be equal or greater than start date for applying leave.
 
Whenever employee applies for leave, the number of days should be calculated based on start and end date of leave.
The leave should be deducted and updated in the leavebalance column of employee.
 The Leave balance after deduction should be greaterthan or equal to 0.
Throw an error message when there is no sufficient leavebalance is available for applying a leave.

Nicetodo:-
Create a leavedetails table with leaveid, employeeid, startdate, enddate, noofdays and insert the same whenever
the employee applies for leave.
The leavedetails record should be updated when the leavebalance is being deducted from the employee table.

The above is the backend operation used as webservice.  The presentation layer is Angular.
One can validate the abover operation using Postman as client or Advance Rest Client (ARC) an opensource application.
